# Physics Informed Neural Operator for ODEs

This tutorial provides an example of how to use the Physics Informed Neural Operator (PINO) for solving a family of parametric ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## Operator Learning for a family of parametric ODEs

In this section, we will define a parametric ODE and then learn it with a PINO using [`PINOODE`](@ref). The PINO will be trained to learn the mapping from the parameters of the ODE to its solution.

```@example pino
using Test
using OptimizationOptimisers
using Lux
using Statistics, Random
using NeuralOperators
using NeuralPDE

# Define the parametric ODE equation
@closure equation = (u, p, t) -> p[1] * cos(p[2] * t) + p[3]
tspan = (0.0, 1.0)
u0 = 1.0
prob = ODEProblem(equation, u0, tspan)

# Set the number of parameters for the ODE
number_of_parameter = 3
# Define the DeepONet architecture for the PINO
deeponet = NeuralOperators.DeepONet(
    Chain(
        Dense(number_of_parameter => 10, Lux.tanh_fast), Dense(10 => 10, Lux.tanh_fast), Dense(10 => 10)),
    Chain(Dense(1 => 10, Lux.tanh_fast), Dense(10 => 10, Lux.tanh_fast),
        Dense(10 => 10, Lux.tanh_fast)))

# Define the bounds for the parameters
bounds = [(1.0, pi), (1.0, 2.0), (2.0, 3.0)]
number_of_parameter_samples = 50
# Define the training strategy
strategy = StochasticTraining(20)
# Define the optimizer
opt = OptimizationOptimisers.Adam(0.03)
alg = PINOODE(deeponet, opt, bounds, number_of_parameters; strategy = strategy)
# Solve the ODE problem using the PINOODE algorithm
sol = solve(prob, alg, verbose = false, maxiters = 4000)
```

Now let's compare the prediction from the learned operator with the ground truth solution which is obtained by analytic solution of the parametric ODE.

```@example pino
using Plots

@closure function get_trainset(bounds, tspan, number_of_parameters, dt)
    p_ = [range(start = b[1], length = number_of_parameters, stop = b[2]) for b in bounds]
    p = vcat([collect(reshape(p_i, 1, size(p_i, 1))) for p_i in p_]...)
    t_ = collect(tspan[1]:dt:tspan[2])
    t = collect(reshape(t_, 1, size(t_, 1), 1))
    (p, t)
end

# Compute the ground truth solution for each parameter
@closure ground_solution = (u0, p, t) -> u0 + p[1] / p[2] * sin(p[2] * t) + p[3] * t
function ground_solution_f(p, t)
    reduce(hcat,
        [[ground_solution(u0, p[:, i], t[j]) for j in axes(t, 2)] for i in axes(p, 2)])
end

# generate the solution with new parameters for test the model
(p, t) = get_trainset(bounds, tspan, 50, 0.025)
# compute the ground truth solution
ground_solution_ = ground_solution_f(p, t)
# predict the solution with the PINO model
predict = sol.interp((p, t))

# calculate the errors between the ground truth solution and the predicted solution
errors = ground_solution_ - predict
# calculate the mean error and the standard deviation of the errors
mean_error = mean(errors)
# calculate the standard deviation of the errors
std_error = std(errors)

p, t = get_trainset(bounds, tspan, 100, 0.01)
ground_solution_ = ground_solution_f(p, t)
predict = sol.interp((p, t))

errors = ground_solution_ - predict
mean_error = mean(errors)
std_error = std(errors)

# Plot the predicted solution and the ground truth solution as a filled contour plot
# predict, represents the predicted solution for each parameter value and time
plot(predict, linetype = :contourf)
plot!(ground_solution_, linetype = :contourf)
```

```@example pino
# 'i' is the index of the parameter 'p' in the dataset 
i = 20
# 'predict' is the predicted solution from the PINO model
plot(predict[:, i], label = "Predicted")
# 'ground' is the ground truth solution
plot!(ground_solution_[:, i], label = "Ground truth")
```
